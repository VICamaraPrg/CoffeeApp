# CoffeeApp

The main idea of the project is to develop some coding skills at Kotlin as well as understand how Android Apps are built.

### What can the App do as of today?
Not so much, really. The App starts a the Login Activity in which we have a basic login form.</br>
I am using data binding to handle data so, when you fill the form will send that data to MainActivity and display it for debug purposes.
The Textview at bottom of login form takes you to Register form, yet to be designed.
